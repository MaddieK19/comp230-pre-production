#COMP230 â€“ Component Proposal 
####Companion AI - Falcon
##What is the product?
A companion AI that controls the falcon in the game. 
The falcon will:
* sit on the characters arm
* scope out ahead - search for enemies
* attack weaker enemies
* catch prey
* collect items?
* stretch - how you treat the falcon effects it's behaviour? may not return for awhile if mean, find more items when happy?

(Need to reseach falconery more)

##Is there a market? Who is the target audience?
* Market as a companion AI system
* Should be adaptable to different animals
* Don't think a falcon has been used as a companion before

##What are the unique selling points?
* 


##Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
* Depends on how many features
