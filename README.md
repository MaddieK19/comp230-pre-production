#COMP230 – Component Proposal 
####Animal AI – Probably birds
##What is the product?
*	The overall game will be a tech demo to show off the three different components
*	My component will be an AI for animals in the game.  
*	The animals will:
  *	React to other NPCs
  *	React differently depending on NPC agression level  
  *	Flock together/behaviour depends on other animals in the flock.  
  
##Is there a market? Who is the target audience?
•	The component could be used in numerous games in the background for general wildlife in the game    
•	It could also be used as the focus of the game if it was a game like ABZU where the animals and interacting with them are a main part of the game.    
•	Could be used in walking simulators, either as a background or a focus in the game.    

##What are the unique selling points?
•	Animals in games tend to just run from player
o	Could make animals more interesting? More immersive?

##Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
•	There’s a lot of papers and tutorials on boid flocking so the flocking behaviour could be implemented using them  
•	The boid flocking would need to be implemented so it works with the animal reacting to the environment.  

The three of us intend to work on the base of the game together and then spilt off into our three separate components. I will contribute to the base of the game and then create my animal AI and flocking.
