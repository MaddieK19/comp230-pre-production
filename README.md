# COMP230  - Pre-production
[All code will be under the Companion AI branch](https://github.com/NecroReindeer/comp230-pre-production/tree/Companion-AI)
# Component Proposal 
#### Companion AI - Falcon
## What is the product?
A companion AI that controls the falcon in the game. 
The falcon will:
* sit on the characters arm
* scope out ahead - search for enemies
* attack weaker enemies
* catch prey
* collect items?
* stretch - how you treat the falcon effects it's behaviour? may not return for awhile if mean, find more items when happy?

(Need to reseach falconery more)

## Is there a market? Who is the target audience?
* Market as a companion AI system
* Should be adaptable to different animals
* Don't think a falcon has been used as a companion before

## What are the unique selling points?
* Birds aren't commonly used in games beyond being in the background


## Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
* Depends on how many features
